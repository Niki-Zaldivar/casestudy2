        <img class="banner" src="./Images/lifelinecs/trio.PNG">
          <p class="bannerText" id="home">
            The first feature neccessary in this partnered app redesign was a 
            simplified login process and a streamlined homepage navigation. 
            Lifeline Animal Project currently has different login portals for each 
            branch of the organization, making it difficult for the user to participate 
            in community outreach in multiple areas without unneccessary effort. 
            The homescreen was transformed to feature a weekly pet that is ready 
            to be adopted. It was very important to the stakeholders at Lifeline 
            that those animals that may be hard to place, are featured above all else. 
            So older dogs and cats, those with manageable health concerns, and breeds deemed 
            aggressive without due cause. These animals are harder to place, and so they
            are more in need of special attention.

    <p class="bannerText">
        The most important, and our most proud highlight, is the development of our swiping 
        pet match feature and the partnered quiz. Our stakeholders expressed a desire to obtain
         an easier way to match and connect potential adoptive pet owners with new furry friends 
         while considering Their lifestyles and desires in a new companion. Through gamification 
         and swiping, we were able to synthesize a system that delights the user and populates 
         real and useful results.

            We conducted our interviews first; we found people who we knew that had adopted, 
            fostered, or volunteered with a shelter. As a bonus, more than one of them had 
            affiliated with Lifeline themselves! Our Stakeholder highlighted the importance 
            of all three branches and mentioned a need for streamlined matchmaking, scheduling, 
            and helping users feel confident about homing a large dog without prejudice. 
            After 8 user interviews and our stakeholder interview, we collected and analyzed our data.

            We found that our users were interested in matchmaking and more contact with shelter 
            staff in the process of adoption and fostering. We also found that people generally 
            didn't know enough about fostering, and therefore, did not participate in what the 
            Stakeholder described as “a crucial part of the animal caregiving process.”

        <h3>Personal Realizations</h3>
        <p class="bannerText">
            The process of understanding the broad spectrum of users who may encounter our app <br>
            led us in a multitude of directions. It became clear that we needed our app to focus<br>
             on the 3 main branches of participation offered by Lifeline Animal Project; <br>
             Adopt, Foster, and Volunteer. <br>
<br>
            While we expected that most of our users would be seeking the love of a pet, we also <br>
            understood that the individual may be seeking to help the organization themselves in <br>
            their capacity to aid the community. With this, we sought to make the process of matching <br>
             an animal with the right home a streamlined process as well as a fun and delightful experience. <br>
            Our team had varrying degrees of love for our furry friends, but at the end of the day, <br>
            none were lacking in the compassion needed to get the job done. <br>

            With three distinct branches (Adopt, Foster, and Volunteer) We developed a story for each, 
            but we focused on the Foster story because it is easily nested between adopting and volunteering. 
            The story we developed follows a young woman and her roommate in an endeavor to foster a cat. 
            We included all of the steps from the app to bringing the animal home and highlighted the information
            and resources provided by the organizaiton in order to facilitate a smooth and pleasant experience. 
            We developed our flow for all three branches and in turn, a prototype with no dead ends. </p>

            After conducting a multitude of interviews and surveys, our team sat down together to analyze
            the responses and prioritize the potential features. We measured the consistency of responses 
            from our individual interviews, surveys, and our conversations with our stakeholder. From there, 
            we brainstormed using a "what if" scenario and a "how might we?" prompt to come up with creative 
            solutions. Finally, we charted our ideas and prioritized the most exciting and doable features 
            that would make the most impact on the user and the organization. Our Priorities were the 
            pet match swipe feature, the convenient appointment scheduling, and the ability to schedule a call
             through the app. </p>

    <h2 class="centerText">Testing & Results</h2>
<img class="banner" src="./Images/lifelinecs/testingbanner.png">
<p class="bannerText">
    The testing phase was extensive. We first developed our wireframes and conducted a series of
    A/B Tests in order to determine the most apealing layout. We found that a combination of our 3 designs was the 
    most user friendly. We resolved ourselves on placing the pet of the week at the top of the home screen, along 
    with the 3 most important branches (Adoopt, Foster, and Volunteer)
    With that, we took our first prototype and conducted a series of individual tasks based on important tasks. We 
    were able to determine a few different changes we needed to make immediately as we applied our styles to the application. 
    <ul>
        <li>Our menu bar needed to be more inutuitive, so we added text beneath each option </li>
        <li>More images were requested to keep the user engaged</li>
        <li>The matching feature needed to be simplified and cleaned up to delight the user</li>
        <li>We arranged the favorites pet list more like a checkout interaction in order to simplify the information out in front of the user</li>
        <li>More information was added to the Foster flow about what the organization provides during the experience</li>
        <li>Processing visuals were added to show the user what step they were on in the quiz and set up process</li>
        <li>Obligatory information was provided casually and conveniently through the apps sign up process in order to inform the user while not overwhelming them with too much information</li>
        <li>More color was added to the accents to show location within application and also highlight important information</li>

    <h2 class="centerText">Iteration</h2>
<img class="banner" src="./Images/lifelinecs/iterationbanner.png">
<p class="bannerText">
In the first phases of testing, it was easy to identify the changes we needed to make in order to meet 
the standards of Lifeline Animal Project. General style changes led to more specific iterations based 
on feedback that was regularly received through ongoing testing. We often made small changes between tests, 
and embarked on bigger changes aften discussion amongst our team. One of the biggest pieces of our iterative 
process was our main Pet Match Swipe feature. We went through a multitude of attempts before landing on a 
simple expansive modal experience to show more information about pets within the swiping function. By the final 
testing phase, we had worked out the bugs and were left with a functioning hi fidelity prototype to be proud of. 
The next phase will be a deeper look at the development process and determine what is truly possible for our app.

    <h2 class="centerText">Conclusion</h2>
<img class="banner" src="./Images/lifelinecs/conclusion.PNG">
<p class="bannerText">
    Across the board, communication seems to be an expected hardship amongst shelters, this problem is not exclusive to Lifeline. We feel that this means more animals end up stuck in a shelter and don't make it to a loving home. We want to improve these odds by helping the shelters with their user communications as well as their inter organization communications to help with information sharing and providing animals a quick and easy transition out of the shelter. Volunteers become discouraged when the shelter is unresponsive, so we wanted to provide that connection in an easier format to insure the longevity and health of all the animals cared for at Lifeline. Future exploration into the below features would continue to improve the efficiency of getting volunteers, finding and meeting with the animals, and provide good resources for the volunteers to better care for the animal in their possession.
<ul>
   <li>Virtual orientation</li> 
   <li>Self led with videos</li> 
    <li>Interactive, in-app face to face virtual meetings while fostering and post adoptive check-ins</li>
    <li>Expand to more shelters </li>
    <li>In app Messaging</li>
</ul>
    We are proud to be a part of the effort to save lives both human and furry, pairing people to their animal friends so each may have a fulfilled life.
