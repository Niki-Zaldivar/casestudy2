            The first feature neccessary in this partnered app redesign was a 
            simplified login process and a streamlined homepage navigation. 
            Lifeline Animal Project currently has different login portals for each 
            branch of the organization, making it difficult for the user to participate 
            in community outreach in multiple areas without unneccessary effort. 
            The homescreen was transformed to feature a weekly pet that is ready 
            to be adopted. It was very important to the stakeholders at Lifeline 
            that those animals that may be hard to place, are featured above all else. 
            So older dogs and cats, those with manageable health concerns, and breeds deemed 
            aggressive without due cause. These animals are harder to place, and so they
            are more in need of special attention.

    <p class="infoleftText">
        The most important, and our most proud highlight, is the development of our swiping 
        pet match feature and the partnered quiz. Our stakeholders expressed a desire to obtain
         an easier way to match and connect potential adoptive pet owners with new furry friends 
         while considering Their lifestyles and desires in a new companion. Through gamification 
         and swiping, we were able to synthesize a system that delights the user and populates 
         real and useful results.

            We conducted our interviews first; we found people who we knew that had adopted, 
            fostered, or volunteered with a shelter. As a bonus, more than one of them had 
            affiliated with Lifeline themselves! Our Stakeholder highlighted the importance 
            of all three branches and mentioned a need for streamlined matchmaking, scheduling, 
            and helping users feel confident about homing a large dog without prejudice. 
            After 8 user interviews and our stakeholder interview, we collected and analyzed our data.

            We found that our users were interested in matchmaking and more contact with shelter 
            staff in the process of adoption and fostering. We also found that people generally 
            didn't know enough about fostering, and therefore, did not participate in what the 
            Stakeholder described as “a crucial part of the animal caregiving process.”

        <h3>Personal Realizations</h3>
        <p class="infoText">
            The process of understanding the broad spectrum of users who may encounter our app <br>
            led us in a multitude of directions. It became clear that we needed our app to focus<br>
             on the 3 main branches of participation offered by Lifeline Animal Project; <br>
             Adopt, Foster, and Volunteer. <br>
<br>
            While we expected that most of our users would be seeking the love of a pet, we also <br>
            understood that the individual may be seeking to help the organization themselves in <br>
            their capacity to aid the community. With this, we sought to make the process of matching <br>
             an animal with the right home a streamlined process as well as a fun and delightful experience. <br>
            Our team had varrying degrees of love for our furry friends, but at the end of the day, <br>
            none were lacking in the compassion needed to get the job done. <br>

            With three distinct branches (Adopt, Foster, and Volunteer) We developed a story for each, 
            but we focused on the Foster story because it is easily nested between adopting and volunteering. 
            The story we developed follows a young woman and her roommate in an endeavor to foster a cat. 
            We included all of the steps from the app to bringing the animal home and highlighted the information
            and resources provided by the organizaiton in order to facilitate a smooth and pleasant experience. 
            We developed our flow for all three branches and in turn, a prototype with no dead ends. </p>

<p class="bannerText">
            After conducting a multitude of interviews and surveys, our team sat down together to analyze
            the responses and prioritize the potential features. We measured the consistency of responses 
            from our individual interviews, surveys, and our conversations with our stakeholder. From there, 
            we brainstormed using a "what if" scenario and a "how might we?" prompt to come up with creative 
            solutions. Finally, we charted our ideas and prioritized the most exciting and doable features 
            that would make the most impact on the user and the organization. Our Priorities were the 
            pet match swipe feature, the convenient appointment scheduling, and the ability to schedule a call
             through the app. </p>
